## FAQ

### Can you add more bundled images?

The bundled images are just meant to be able to quickly try out the app. The point is to use your own images or from a service like Unsplash.

### Can you support Unsplash?

I don't plan to integrate with Unsplash. There is a better way. Save the images you want in the [Unsplash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unsplash/id1290631746) app, open the Photos app, go to one of the images, tap the share button, and tap “Make Blurry Wallpaper”.
